Assassins
=========

Assassins adds a different style option for PVP by allowing players to become and/or hire "assassins" on their servers.

Players can create "contracts" on other players requesting that 
they be assassinated for a given price. Any player can then choose to become an "Assassin" by choosing a player off 
the "Wanted" list and then going out to kill them.

Once you choose to take on a contract, you are given a specific amount of time to accomplish that assassination, or 
the contract goes back to the wanted list for someone else to try.

If you succeed at killing the player, you get paid the money from all the current contracts on that players' head at 
the time of the killing.
